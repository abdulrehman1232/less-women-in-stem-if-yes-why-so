# ROLE OF TECHNOLOGICAL PREFERENCES IN WOMEN EMPOWERMENT

The advancement and development of nations lies in equal opportunities and rights for every citizen regardless of race, gender, color and status. This level is achieved at the basic level of society where the women and men get the same rights to grow in every sphere of life.
A little sneak in near history, the Industrial revolution and the world wars I and II created more work opportunities for women. Women started to get more rights and secure workplaces compared to previous times. Also, the patriarchal mindset in society changed a lot after women rights campaigns and struggles.
In the present day, we see much improvement and development in women roles in different fields, especially STEM. Different scenarios have strengthened their roles and jobs even more, e.g., the recent covid epidemic in 2020 caused havoc throughout the world, but on the other hand, it created dignified job opportunities for women at home.
All these facts show the betterment in jobs and equal pay for women, but still the number of women in advance fields specially STEM remain male dominant. This difference in gender participation in professional domain needs deep research and analysis of work environments and cultures to encourage and facilitate more indulgence of females in STEM sectors, esp., data sciences.
